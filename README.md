This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

The idea of this project is to create a simple webcomic reader with basic functionality to navigate through pages.

The artwork is done by me as well

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to run locally.

You can see also this in action [here](https://webcomic-pages.vercel.app/)
